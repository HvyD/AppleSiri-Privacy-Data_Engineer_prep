# Apple-Siri Privacy Team Data Engineer-interview-prep

## Three Separate Rounds Total via WebEx - All technical. not a single behavioral question was ask or for that matter my experiences and education. Just straight into Data Structures and Algorithms. DS&A is good for interviewing but in my decades of experience there is a vast difference in day to day operations. Another Flawed hiring practice, imho.

* First round with engineer was ask to find the Minimum Window Substring coding question and return a True Shuffle of an Array.
only had time after to be ask:
        1. What is the difference between repartition and coalesce?

* Second Round was with another Engineer. I was asked to write a Multi-Threaded Scheduler. They wanted to see how you check the queue and put in a delay.
        1. How would you check a JVM run time for stats on which methods are taking the longest to run?
        2. How would you performance tune a Spark application to make it run more efficiently?
        3.  Explain the Big O theory
        4. Compare Spark and Hadoop, list reasons and examples why Spark would outperform Hadoop

* Third and final was with Hiring manager. I was asked only one coding question of how to Count Distinct Elements in an array. Then make it absolutely efficient, them describe and write out how it would scale for big data.


## I have provided all my Solutions I came up with of All Coding and verbal questions actually asked during interview plus a few LeetCode practice and additional verbal questions I felt could have been ask of me.

# NO offer was extended so I would not take my solution as Gold.......
